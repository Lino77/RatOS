# What is RatOS?

RatOS is a comprehensive 3D printer firmware solution that combines Klipper, Moonraker, Mainsail, and KlipperScreen into an easy-to-use, point-and-click configuration system. It is developed and maintained by Mikkel Schmidt (miklschmidt#2036 on the Rat Rig Unofficial Discord).

## How does it work?

RatOS simplifies the complex world of Klipper-based 3D printing by providing:

1. A pre-configured Raspberry Pi image with all necessary software components
2. An intuitive web-based configurator that lets you:
   - Select from 12+ supported printers and 45+ control and toolboards
   - Configure toolhead hardware (supporting up to 2 toolheads per printer)
   - Set up multiple toolboards
   - Fine-tune motor and driver configurations
   - Automatically apply tested driver tuning presets for known configurations
3. Fully automated firmware and system updates
4. Extensive collection of configurable macros for:
   - Automated print start/end sequences
   - Smart filament handling and sensor integration
   - Chamber temperature control
   - Adaptive bed meshing and nozzle priming
   - Intelligent pause/resume functionality
   - Temperature-aware probe operations
   - Input shaper calibration tools

The system automatically generates and maintains your printer's configuration files, significantly reducing the need for manual editing or command-line interaction. When you make hardware changes, RatOS updates your configuration automatically and shows you the changes for review.

## Advanced Features

Beyond basic configuration, RatOS includes:
1. Realtime Analysis Tool (RAT) for live power spectral density analysis
   - input shaper calibration
   - belt tension tuning with peak detection and mechanical health estimation
   - oscillator for resonance hunting 
2. Visually Assisted Offset Calibration (VAOC) for precise multi-toolhead calibration
3. Advanced IDEX support with blazing fast toolshifting and multi-color printing
4. Automated firmware and system updates

RatOS's main design principle is that users shouldn't need command-line knowledge to use Klipper on their 3D printer. However, for advanced users, RatOS remains fully compatible with standard Klipper configuration, allowing you to leverage its tools while maintaining full control over your setup.

## What do I need?

To run RatOS on your printer you need a supported control board and a Raspberry Pi or BTT CB1 (experimental).

### Currently supported host computers

-   Raspberry Pi 3 (A+/B/B+)
-   Raspberry Pi 4B
-   Raspberry Pi 400
-   Raspberry Pi Zero 2
-   Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 Lite for use with SD Cards
-   Raspberry pi Compute Module 4 with at least 16gb eMMC (more complicated to set up)

#### Community supported host computers
-   Big Tree Tech CB1 (experimental)

## Software Credits

RatOS is based on [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), [Moonraker](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Mainsail](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/), [MainsailOS](https://github.com/raymondh2/MainsailOS) and [KlipperScreen](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/) without these and the amazing people behind them, RatOS would not have been possible.
